# Parallax Scroll Animation

This project showcases a smooth and visually appealing parallax scroll animation built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As you scroll down the page, the scene dynamically transitions from morning to night, simulating the passage of time. 

## Features
- Parallax scrolling effect for immersive depth
- Day-to-night transition triggered by scroll
- Fully responsive and lightweight
- Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How it Works
The animation listens to the scroll position and adjusts the background and elements to simulate the natural progression of a day. The closer you scroll to the bottom, the later the time of day becomes, creating a seamless transition from sunrise to sunset and night.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parallax-scroll-animation.git
